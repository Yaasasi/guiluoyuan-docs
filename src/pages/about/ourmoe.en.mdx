# About Us

## Introduction

Ourmoe, originated from passion, persists because of passion, and remains steadfast because of dreams. We are dedicated to integrating all those who love life, uphold integrity, and are friendly and kind-hearted. We strive to work together with all community members to build a joyful and memorable interest community, creating a warm, harmonious, friendly, beautiful, and diverse community. We aim to establish a community with a clear theme and authentic content, and encourage content that is filled with love, interest, and usefulness to flourish within the community.

Since 2018, we have been providing support for community rule formulation to numerous public communities, offering content related to the "[Community Chat Convention](../docs/treaty/community_communication_covenant)" and its surrounding services. Additionally, we have launched several community servers for popular games such as Minecraft and Terraria.
